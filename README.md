This repository contains code to classify articles of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The code is written in Python and utilizes the TensorFlow library for deep learning.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is included in the TensorFlow library. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image belonging to one of 10 classes:

- 0: T-shirt/top
- 1: Trouser
- 2: Pullover
- 3: Dress
- 4: Coat
- 5: Sandal
- 6: Shirt
- 7: Sneaker
- 8: Bag
- 9: Ankle boot

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Files
- `fashion_code.py`: contains the python code for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Follow the instructions to execute the code and train the model.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test dataset.
